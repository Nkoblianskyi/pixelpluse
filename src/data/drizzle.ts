    title: 'Drizzle ORM: Type-Safe SQL for TypeScript Developers',
    content: `
  Drizzle ORM is a modern, ** type - safe ** Object - Relational Mapping(ORM) tool designed specifically for ** TypeScript ** and modern full - stack development.With a minimalistic design and first - class type support, Drizzle is quickly becoming a top choice for developers who want ** maximum safety **, ** auto - complete support **, and ** clean SQL semantics ** in their applications.

  ### 📚 What Is Drizzle ORM ?
  
    Drizzle ORM allows developers to interact with SQL databases(PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) in a ** fully typed and declarative ** way using TypeScript.It provides a ** typed schema layer **, ** migrations **, and ** query builders ** — all with a developer experience(DX) that feels seamless inside a TypeScript project.
  
  Unlike traditional ORMs that abstract away SQL entirely, Drizzle embraces SQL and provides type - safe APIs to make database operations expressive and reliable.

  ### 🚀 Why Use Drizzle ?
  
  - ** Type Safety **: Every query, insert, and update is statically typed.You catch schema mismatches at compile time.
  - ** Excellent DX **: Enjoy full auto - complete, inline hints, and IDE integration.
  - ** Zero runtime overhead **: Drizzle compiles down to simple SQL queries.
  - ** Works with modern stacks **: Ideal for apps built with Next.js, NestJS, tRPC, or Astro.
  - ** Simple migration system **: Declarative migration files written in code.
  - ** Supports native SQL **: You’re never locked out of raw SQL power.

  ### 🧑‍💻 Example Schema
  
  Here’s how simple it is to define and query a Drizzle schema:
  
  \`\`\`ts
  import { pgTable, serial, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
  
  export const users = pgTable('users', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
    name: text('name'),
  });
  \`\`\`
  
  And a query:
  
  \`\`\`ts
  const allUsers = await db.select().from(users);
  \`\`\`
  
  Thanks to static typing, this code provides autocomplete and guards you from invalid fields or types.

  ### 🔄 Migrations
  
  Drizzle’s migration system is file-based and written in code. No separate DSL or external config — just clean, consistent, versioned TypeScript files.
  
  \`\`\`ts
  export const migration = async () => {
    await db.execute(sql\`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (...)\`);
  };
  \`\`\`
  
  This makes CI/CD and team collaboration more predictable and transparent.

  - **Next.js** apps with React Server Components
  - **NestJS** APIs
  - **tRPC** or **GraphQL** backends
  - Serverless or edge function backends on Vercel, Netlify
