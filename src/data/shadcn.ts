  **shadcn/ui** is a modern, open-source headless UI component library for building accessible and highly customizable user interfaces with **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI**.
  
  ---
  
  ### What Is shadcn/ui?
  
  Unlike traditional UI libraries that come bundled as npm packages, shadcn/ui provides ready-to-copy **component source code** that you add directly to your project. This gives you **complete control** over styling, behavior, and structure — with no vendor lock-in.
  
  It is ideal for teams that want consistency, accessibility, and freedom when building custom interfaces.

  ### Core Technologies
  
  - **Radix UI**: A low-level library providing fully accessible primitives (modals, dropdowns, tooltips).
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling directly in JSX/TSX.
  - **TypeScript**: Strongly typed components for better safety and DX.
  
  ---
  
  ### Key Benefits
  
  - ✅ **Copy & Own the Code**: No hidden styles or dependencies. Modify freely.
  - ✅ **Headless Architecture**: Style everything with Tailwind — no pre-baked themes.
  - ✅ **Great DX**: Full TypeScript support, accessible out of the box.
  - ✅ **Customizable**: Create your own design system or adapt to existing ones.
  - ✅ **Composable**: Combine with framer-motion, zod, radix, or your own utilities.

  ### Getting Started
  
  To use shadcn/ui, you typically run:
  
  \`\`\`bash
  npx shadcn-ui@latest init
  \`\`\`
  
  You then add components one by one using:
  
  \`\`\`bash
  npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
  \`\`\`
  
  The component code is copied directly into your local directory — no need to import anything from a remote package.
  
  ---
  
  ### Advanced Usage
  
  - Extend existing components with slots and Tailwind modifiers.
  - Integrate seamlessly with form libraries (like \`react-hook-form\`) or schema validation tools (like \`zod\`).
  - Use **Framer Motion** for animations.
  - Add variants via utility classes or component composition.

  ### When to Use It?
  
  shadcn/ui is perfect for:
  
  - Building your own **design system**
  - Projects with strict accessibility requirements
  - Developers who want full control over UI
  - Next.js, Remix, or Vite projects using Tailwind

  ### Final Thoughts
  
  shadcn/ui is more than a component library — it’s a development philosophy centered around **ownership**, **accessibility**, and **customizability**. By giving developers the code directly, it empowers teams to move faster without compromising on quality or flexibility.
  
  If you’re serious about building refined interfaces with full control, shadcn/ui is one of the most modern and scalable options available today.
